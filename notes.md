* WASI-II
Raw score to T score

Raw score from vocabulary and matrix reasoning, age (Y/M), gender
-> Tscore for vocab, Tscore for matrix reasoning

THEN
SUM Tscores = Full scale-2 score

Convert sum of 2 scores to composite score (using table), also return percentile rank and 95% confidence interval

Need table A.1 and table A.6

only 8-12 yr olds

Table A.1 form

int T-score
int BD
int VC
int MR
int SI
int AgeYear
int AgeMonth

Table A.6 form
int sum_of_t_scores
int FSIQ-2
float percentile rank
age_range
90% interval
95% interval


* CLES-C test
2 tests (1 for kiddo, 1 for parent)

sum circled numbers for each column
columns are d1,c1,b1,a1,a2,b2,c2,d2

A = a1 + a2
B = A + b1 + b2
C = B + c1 + c2
D = C + d1 + d2

Then use table


Takes age and A,B,C,D
If x > xTable (for x = A,B,C,D) then at risk

* BRIEF-A self-report

First, offline, transfer numbers to columns
sum each column over both pages, then sum the totals
This gives raw scores
Then copy raw scores to informant report scoring summary with age and gender
Sum results into BRI and MI subtotals
Then sum BRI and MI into GEC

Use a table to convert into T scores, percentiles, 90% confidence intervals
Using age and raw scores

** Negativity Scale
Count number of negativity items that were scored with 3, then sum totalsThen calculate classification

** Infrequency Scale
Tally infrequency scale (marked F and bolded in box)
then as negativity scale

** Inconsistency scale
Transfer scores based on item no in table. calculate difference between pairs, then sum differences then lookup as in previous scales

* BRIEF parent
same as BRIEF-A without infrequency scale (and diff tables), gender,age parent/teacher

BRI and MI categories are different

* PRQ

Circles are given

For each box, sum things coming from arrows

Sum each column

Transfer sums to other sheet.

Then add numbers that are omitted * 2 to get raw score

Then use table to convert to T score, confidence intervals and percentile ranks
Need to know gender of parent and kiddo age

after looking up t scores

validity indexes

First F-index, count number of unshaded responses that are marked then look up classification

D-scale count number of sums that are at max value, then look up classification
